# node-unblocker

A web proxy for evading corporate or government filters, similar to CGIproxy / PHProxy / Glype but 
written in node.js. All data is processed and relayed to the client on the fly without unnecessary 
buffering.

Any website that the proxy can access can now be reached by the proxy's users.

### The magic part

The script uses "pretty" urls which, besides looking pretty, allow links with relative paths 
to just work without modification. (E.g. `<a href="path/to/file2.html"></a>`) 

In addition to this, links that are relative to the root (E.g. `<a href="/path/to/file2.html"></a>`) 
can be handled without modification by checking the referrer and 307 redirecting them to the proper 
location in the referring site. (Although the proxy does attempt to rewrite these links to avoid the redirect.)

Cookies are currently storred in the visitor's session on the server rather than being sent to the 
visitor's browser to avoid having a large number of (possibly conflicting) browser cookies once they
have browsed several sites through the proxy.

## Installation on your system

Requires [node.js](http://nodejs.org/) >= 0.8 (0.10 is recommended) and [Redis](http://redis.io/) for session storage. 
Then [download node-unblocker](https://github.com/nfriedly/node-unblocker/archive/master.zip), `cd` into the directory, 
and run `npm rebuild`. Optionally edit 
config.js then run `npm start` to start the server. It should spawn a new instance for each CPU 
core you have. 

(Note: running `node app.js` *will not work*. The server code is in the [Gatling](https://npmjs.org/package/gatling) package, which the `npm start` command calls automatically.)

## Installation on Heroku

This project should be runnable on a free [Heroku](http://www.heroku.com/) instance without 
modification - see http://node-unblocker.herokuapp.com/proxy for an example. You will want to run the 
following commands:

    heroku addons:add redistogo
    heroku config:add SECRET=<TYPE SOMETHING SECRET AND/OR RANDOM HERE>
    
This sets up a free redis cache instance and secures your cookies.

Optionally, you may want to run one or both of the following lines:

    # newrelic monitoring so that you can be alerted when there's an issue
    heroku addons:add newrelic:stark
    
    # google analytics so that you can see how much usage your proxy is getting
    heroku config:add GA_ID=[your Google Analytics ID, ex: UA-12345-78]

## Todo

* Write more tests: character encoding, compression, end-to-end tests in real browsers
* Consider gzipping all appropriate responses (anything text-like and more than a few kb)
* Break things into sub-modules and make the core easier to embed and extend

## Maybe Todo list

* Mini-url form
* Allow for removal of scripts (both script tags and on*= handlers)
